# Contributing

Firstly, thanks for considering contributing!

## Issues

Thank you for creating them and doing so respectfully.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Updated Bluetooth functionality

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that and what it was addressing

> Updated Bluetooth connect/disconnect functionality to address drop-outs

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me
the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

  - It is consistently written code, fitting in with the rest of the code
  - It has comments where needed
  - It is specific to hardware devices only where it should be (e.g. in the respective main.cpp file) otherwise it is suitable for the majority of devices

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is:

  - To provide a code base for connecting to and controlling Blackmagic Design cameras using their Camera Control protocol
  - Support the community of video and film makers
  - Foster a culture of respect and gratitude in the open source community.

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will remove things that do not respect it.
